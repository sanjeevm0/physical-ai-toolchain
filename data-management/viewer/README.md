# Dataset Analysis Tool

A full-stack application for analyzing and annotating robotic training data from episode-based datasets. Features include episode browsing, frame annotation, and export capabilities.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) - serves REST API on port 8000
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript - runs on port 5173 with API proxy

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Installation

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment (using uv)
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (include 'azure' extra for blob storage support)
uv pip install -e ".[dev,export,azure]"
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Configuration

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set values for your environment.

### Local File Storage (default)

```env
STORAGE_BACKEND=local
DATA_DIR=/path/to/your/datasets
```

### Azure Blob Storage

Use this mode when datasets live in Azure Blob Storage. Authentication uses
[DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication-overview),
which supports managed identity, workload identity, and Azure CLI credentials
automatically — no SAS token required in AKS or Container Apps.

```env
STORAGE_BACKEND=azure
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=mystorageaccount
AZURE_STORAGE_DATASET_CONTAINER=datasets
AZURE_STORAGE_ANNOTATION_CONTAINER=annotations
# Leave AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN unset to use managed identity (MSI)
```

Expected blob structure:

```text
{dataset_id}/meta/info.json
{dataset_id}/meta/tasks.parquet
{dataset_id}/data/chunk-000/file-000.parquet
{dataset_id}/videos/{camera}/chunk-000/file-000.mp4
{dataset_id}/annotations/episodes/episode_000000.json
```

### VLM-as-Judge (experimental)

The viewer can score episodes with a vision-language-model (VLM) judge, reusing the
`evaluation.vlm_judge` harness. The router mounts only when `VLM_JUDGE_ENABLED=true`;
the frontend's JudgePanel auto-hides when the backend reports the judge is disabled.

#### What it does

The VLM-as-judge feature samples a fixed number of
still frames — `VLM_JUDGE_N_FRAMES` (default 12) — evenly spaced across the
episode's time window, decodes them with PyAV, letterboxes each to a fixed square
(default 448×448), and, for multi-camera datasets, tiles the per-view frames
side-by-side so every timestep becomes one composite image. The model therefore
reasons over an ordered sequence of `N` sampled frames.
Frame extraction and tiling live in [`evaluation/vlm_judge/frames.py`](../../evaluation/vlm_judge/frames.py)
and [`service.py`](../../evaluation/vlm_judge/service.py); the scoring chain lives
in [`judge.py`](../../evaluation/vlm_judge/judge.py) and [`agent.py`](../../evaluation/vlm_judge/agent.py).

From that frame sequence the judge produces four outputs, shown in the **VLM Judge**
card on the trajectory tab:

- **Outcome** — `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `Inconclusive`, with a confidence
  percentage. The same SUCCESS/FAILURE multiple-choice question is sampled several
  times (default 3, at temperature 0.6 / top-p 0.95) and decided by self-consistency
  majority vote: the episode is `SUCCESS` when at least half the valid votes say so.
  Confidence is the fraction of valid votes for the winning answer; responses that
  do not parse are discarded, and `Inconclusive` means no vote parsed (`judge.py`,
  `agent.py`).
- **Process reward** — a per-frame task-completion score (0–100%) plus a single
  `VOC` value. `VOC` (value–order correlation) is the Spearman rank correlation
  between the predicted per-frame progress and the true chronological order: `+1`
  when progress rises monotonically, `0` when unordered, negative when inverted
  (`value_order_correlation` in `judge.py`). The per-frame scores are produced by
  one of two strategies selected with `VLM_JUDGE_PROCESS_METHOD` (see below).
- **Milestones** — named sub-steps (e.g. *approach object*, *grasp object*) marked
  complete or incomplete, each with a frame range and a short justification.
  Milestone decomposition runs only when the outcome is uncertain (confidence below
  0.85), inconclusive, or a failure — not on every run — to limit visual-grounding
  hallucination (`agent.py`).
- **Failure mode** — only when the outcome is `FAILURE`: a short category describing
  what went wrong (e.g. *missed grasp*).

#### How to use it

1. Enable the judge and start the viewer with `./start.sh`. It installs the
  lightweight `physical-ai-vlm-judge` package into the backend environment and
  adds local model dependencies only when `VLM_JUDGE_BACKEND=qwen3-vl`:

   ```bash
   VLM_JUDGE_ENABLED=true VLM_JUDGE_BACKEND=qwen3-vl ./start.sh
   ```

2. Open a dataset, select an episode, and switch to the **Trajectory** tab.
3. Click **Run judge**. The first run invokes the model; results are cached per
   dataset under `annotations/vlm_judge/`, so re-opening the episode is instant.
   Use **Re-evaluate** / **Force fresh** to ignore the cache and run again.

> [!NOTE]
> The default `echo` backend returns deterministic placeholder judgments (no model
> is loaded). It exists to verify the wiring end-to-end and for tests — switch to
> `qwen3-vl` (local GPU) or `openai-compat` (a remote vLLM/NIM/Azure OpenAI server)
> for real scores.

#### Applying judgments as episode labels

The judge's outcome maps directly onto the viewer's episode label set
(`SUCCESS` / `FAILURE` / `PARTIAL`), so a judgment can be promoted to a saved label:

- **Apply label** writes the current episode's outcome as its label
  (`SUCCESS` → `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE` → `FAILURE`, `Inconclusive` → `PARTIAL`). It
  replaces any existing outcome label while preserving other custom labels on the
  episode, then persists via the labels API.

#### Scoring every episode

The **Whole dataset** controls run the judge across all episodes — sequentially,
one episode at a time, not as a single batched model call. Each episode reuses the
per-episode endpoint and its cache, so episodes already scored return instantly and
only those not yet scored invoke the model. A progress indicator shows
`done / total`, and **Cancel** stops the run after the in-flight episode.

- **Run all** scores every episode with the selected scoring technique but writes
  no labels. It uses each episode's saved instruction, or the instruction from
  dataset metadata when no saved annotation exists.
- **Label all** scores every episode and writes each outcome as that episode's
  label, using the same outcome → label mapping as **Apply label** above.

> [!NOTE]
> Sequential scoring with a local backend is slow: the model loads on the first
> episode and each subsequent episode runs a full judgment chain. Prefer a hosted
> `openai-compat` backend for whole-dataset runs, and leave results cached so reruns
> skip already-scored episodes.

#### "Run judge" vs. "Language instruction"

The judge scores the episode against a **task instruction** — the natural-language
goal for the episode, such as *"Grab orange and place into plate"*. **Run judge** uses
the instruction currently shown in the viewer's **Language Instruction** panel (your
saved or in-progress edit), so refining that text changes what the judge grades against.
In short:

- **Language Instruction** = *what the robot was asked to do* (the goal the
  judge grades against).
- **Run judge** = *grade this episode against that goal* and report the outcome,
  progress, milestones, and any failure mode.

When the Language Instruction is left empty, **Run judge** falls back to the task
instruction stored in the dataset's metadata. If neither is available, it returns an
error asking you to add or save a Language Instruction.

Whole-dataset actions do not reuse the current unsaved Language Instruction for every
episode. They score each episode against that episode's saved annotation text, falling
back to dataset metadata when needed.

#### Settings

Enable the judge via `start.sh`, or install the backend `vlm-judge` extra before
launching the backend manually. Install `vlm-judge-local` when using the
in-process `qwen3-vl` backend without `start.sh`.

| `VLM_JUDGE_PROCESS_METHOD` | `gvl`                       | Process-reward method: `gvl` (shuffle-and-rank) or `chronological`                    |

> [!NOTE]
> **Process-reward method (`VLM_JUDGE_PROCESS_METHOD`).** The per-frame progress
> histogram comes from one of two strategies:
>
> - `gvl` (default) shows the frames **shuffled** and asks the model to rank each
>   by completion, then re-orders them ([GVL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04549)).
>   Shuffling prevents the model from faking a monotonic ramp from frame position,
>   so it is the more rigorous signal — but it needs a capable VLM. Small local
>   models (e.g. `Qwen3-VL-4B`) often collapse to a flat/empty histogram under it.
> - `chronological` shows the frames in order and asks for the same per-frame
>   score. It yields fuller curves with small models, at the cost of being easier
>   to game positionally.
>
> Recommendation: keep `gvl` with an 8B+ or hosted model; switch to
> `chronological` when running a small local model and you want a populated
> histogram. Changing the method invalidates cached judgments automatically.

#### Request timeouts

The `/judge` request stays open until model loading and inference finish. Local
`qwen3-vl` runs can take minutes on the first request because the backend loads
the model in-process. Configure any reverse proxy, ingress, or browser-facing
gateway timeout above the expected first-run latency, or run the model through the
`openai-compat` shim so the dataviewer backend remains lightweight.

#### Local model via the openai-compat shim

`VLM_JUDGE_BACKEND=qwen3-vl` loads the model inside the dataviewer backend process.
To keep the backend environment lightweight, run the model in a separate process —
the bundled OpenAI-compatible shim — and point the dataviewer at it with
`VLM_JUDGE_BACKEND=openai-compat` and `VLM_JUDGE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1`:

```bash
uv run --project ../../evaluation/vlm_judge --extra api --extra qwen3-vl \
  python -m evaluation.vlm_judge.openai_shim \
  --port 8001 \
  --model-id Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct
```

The shim reads these variables ([`evaluation/vlm_judge/openai_shim.py`](../../evaluation/vlm_judge/openai_shim.py)):

| Variable                          | Default                     | Description                                                           |

## 🔒 Authentication with Entra ID

The application supports Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication for public-facing deployments. When auth is disabled (the default for local development), all requests bypass authentication. When enabled, the frontend uses MSAL.js to acquire tokens via PKCE, and the backend validates JWT tokens against the Entra ID JWKS endpoint.

### Entra ID Prerequisites

1. An [Azure AD app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) with:
   - **Single-page application** redirect URI set to your frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for local dev, `https://your-app.azurecontainerapps.io` for production)
   - An **API scope** named `access_as_user` under "Expose an API" (`api://<client-id>/access_as_user`)
   - Optional **App roles** defined for role-based access control (e.g., `Dataviewer.Viewer`, `Dataviewer.Annotator`, `Dataviewer.Admin`)

2. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** from the app registration.

### Backend Configuration

Set these environment variables in `backend/.env` (or as container environment variables):

```env
DATAVIEWER_AUTH_DISABLED=false
DATAVIEWER_AUTH_PROVIDER=azure_ad
DATAVIEWER_AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>
DATAVIEWER_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
DATAVIEWER_SECURE_COOKIES=true   # Set to true when behind HTTPS
```

The backend validates incoming `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers using RS256 and the Entra ID JWKS endpoint. When `DATAVIEWER_AUTH_DISABLED=true` (default), all authentication checks are bypassed.

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend uses build-time environment variables to configure MSAL.js. Set these before building:

```env
VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>
```

When `VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is set, the app wraps in an `MsalProvider` and attaches Bearer tokens to all API requests. When unset, MSAL is not initialized and the app runs without authentication (suitable for VPN-only access).

### Docker Compose with Auth

```bash
export DATAVIEWER_AUTH_DISABLED=false
export VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
export VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>
docker compose up --build
```

The frontend Dockerfile passes `VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID` as build arguments. The backend receives `DATAVIEWER_AUTH_DISABLED` as a runtime environment variable.

### Auth Environment Variable Reference

| Variable                     | Location              | Description                                                |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATAVIEWER_AUTH_DISABLED`   | Backend               | Set to `false` to enable auth (`true` disables all checks) |
| `DATAVIEWER_AUTH_PROVIDER`   | Backend               | Auth provider: `apikey`, `azure_ad`, or `auth0`            |
| `DATAVIEWER_AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Backend               | Entra ID tenant ID (GUID)                                  |
| `DATAVIEWER_AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Backend               | App registration client ID (GUID)                          |
| `DATAVIEWER_SECURE_COOKIES`  | Backend               | Set to `true` for HTTPS deployments                        |
| `VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID`       | Frontend (build-time) | Same client ID — enables MSAL.js when set                  |
| `VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID`       | Frontend (build-time) | Same tenant ID — used for authority URL                    |

### Token Flow

```text
Browser → Entra ID (MSAL.js PKCE) → access_token
   ↓
   Bearer token → FastAPI backend (JWT validation)
   ↓
   Backend → Azure Storage (Managed Identity, not user token)
```

The backend accesses Azure Storage using managed identity, not the user's token. User authentication and storage authentication are independent.

## Running the Application

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
./start.sh
```

This launches both backend and frontend in the correct order, with health checking and graceful shutdown.

**Options:**

```bash
./start.sh --backend   # Start backend only
./start.sh --frontend  # Start frontend only
./start.sh --help      # Show all options
```

### Manual Start

#### Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

#### Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Annotation Features

The annotation workspace exposes per-episode controls grouped by panel. Persisted state is stored alongside the dataset and surfaced through the REST API.

### Multi-camera viewing

Datasets that record multiple camera streams (e.g. `observation.images.front`, `observation.images.wrist`) drive a camera selector in the annotation workspace header. The selector lists every camera advertised by the episode's `cameras` array, falling back to the keys of `videoUrls` when the array is empty.

| Behavior          | Detail                                                                                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default selection | First entry in `episode.cameras` (or `videoUrls`)                                               |
| Override          | User selection persists for the current episode                                                 |
| Stale fallback    | When the selected camera is missing on episode change, selection resets to the new `cameras[0]` |
| Frame extraction  | The chosen camera drives both video playback and `/frames/{idx}` thumbnail requests             |

### Language instruction (VLA annotation)

Each episode can carry a structured `LanguageInstructionAnnotation` for vision-language-action training. The widget appears in the annotation panel and writes through `PUT /api/datasets/{id}/episodes/{idx}/annotations`.

| Field                  | Purpose                                                                                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `instruction`          | Primary natural-language task description (max 1000 characters)                                       |
| `source`               | Provenance: `human`, `template`, `llm-generated`, or `retroactive`                                    |
| `language`             | BCP-47 language tag, defaults to `en`                                                                 |
| `paraphrases`          | Alternative phrasings for data augmentation (up to 50 entries, 1000 characters each)                  |
| `subtask_instructions` | Ordered subtask decomposition for hierarchical conditioning (up to 100 entries, 1000 characters each) |

When a dataset task description is available, the widget seeds the instruction with `source = template` via the "Use as Instruction" button. Otherwise, "Add Instruction" creates a blank instruction with `source = human`. The source can be changed at any time through the dropdown.

## Container Deployment

### Docker Compose (local)

```bash
# Local storage mode (mount datasets directory)
DATAVIEWER_HOST_DATA_DIR=/path/to/datasets docker compose up --build

# Azure Blob Storage mode
export STORAGE_BACKEND=azure
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=mystorageaccount
export AZURE_STORAGE_DATASET_CONTAINER=datasets
export AZURE_STORAGE_ANNOTATION_CONTAINER=annotations
docker compose up --build
```

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) / Container Apps

For AKS with workload identity or Container Apps with managed identity, set:

```env
STORAGE_BACKEND=azure
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=mystorageaccount
AZURE_STORAGE_DATASET_CONTAINER=datasets
BACKEND_HOST=0.0.0.0
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-url.example.com
```

`AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN` is **not** needed — `DefaultAzureCredential` automatically
uses the pod/container managed identity when running in Azure.

### Building Images

```bash
# Backend
docker build -t dataviewer-backend ./backend

# Frontend
docker build -t dataviewer-frontend ./frontend
```

## Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
pytest

# Lint
ruff check src/

# Lint with auto-fix
ruff check src/ --fix
```

### Frontend Development

All frontend validation runs through npm scripts in `data-management/viewer/frontend/`.

```bash
cd frontend

# Full validation (type-check + lint + test)
npm run validate

# Individual checks
npm run type-check   # TypeScript compilation
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run test         # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:watch   # Vitest in watch mode
npm run format       # Prettier check
npm run format:fix   # Prettier auto-fix
npm run build        # Production build
```

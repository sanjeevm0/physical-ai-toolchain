This roadmap covers planned work for the Physical AI Toolchain through Q1 2027.
Six priority areas align to milestones v0.2.0 through v0.7.0, progressing from documentation through security hardening.
An additional v0.8.0 milestone covers dependency update automation.
The Tier Ladder Rollout priority phases the repository reorganization around the `T0`–`T5` adoption ladder defined in the [Repository Architecture](architecture.md#the-tier-ladder) and the canonical [Tier Model](../design/tier-model.md).
Each area lists concrete deliverables with linked issues and explicit items we will not pursue.
Tier IDs, stage names, boundaries, and the fleet vocabulary are defined once in the canonical [Tier Model](../design/tier-model.md); this roadmap cites them rather than redefining them.

## Current State

The project reached v0.1.0 on 2026-02-07 with 30 commits on main and 24 merged pull requests.
Seven milestones are planned through v0.8.0, spanning foundation work through security hardening.
OpenSSF Best Practices Passing criteria are approximately 85% met (43 Met, 7 Partial, 12 Gap, 6 N/A).

### Tier Ladder Rollout (Q2 2026 – Q3 2026)

All future enhancements, features, and functionality align to the `T0`–`T5` adoption ladder defined in the [Repository Architecture](architecture.md#the-tier-ladder) and the canonical [Tier Model](../design/tier-model.md). The eight lifecycle domains are components adopted per tier; new work items target a specific tier and follow the patterns, specifications, and directory structure established in the architecture.

Tiers roll out in three phases based on dependency order and infrastructure readiness. The phases respect the two canonical boundaries: the **multi-site boundary (Arc)** between `T3` and `T4`, and the **intelligence boundary** between `T4` and `T5`.

| Phase | Timeline | Tiers                    | Boundary crossed                    |
|-------|----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1     | Q2 2026  | T0 Dev, T1 Lab, T2 Pilot | (single site, manual deployment)    |
| 2     | Q2 2026  | T3 Production            | up to the multi-site boundary       |
| 3     | Q3 2026  | T4 Scale, T5 Operate     | multi-site + intelligence (roadmap) |

Phase 1 surfaces the already-working local floor (`T0`), then layers the storage-only lab tier (`T1`) and the recommended cloud-training pilot tier (`T2`). All of these satisfy Goal: Full Training Lifecycle with manual deployment and no required Kubernetes.
Phase 2 adds single-site declarative deployment (`T3`: local k3s + FluxCD, **no Arc**), proving GitOps does not require a cloud fleet control plane.
Phase 3 crosses the multi-site boundary into **fleet delivery** (`T4`: Arc + AKS/Flux + gating) and names the **fleet intelligence** roadmap (`T5`).

**Will Do:**

* ~~Migrate existing Terraform IaC from `deploy/001-iac/` into `infrastructure/terraform/`~~ (complete)
* ~~Migrate existing setup scripts from `deploy/002-setup/` into `infrastructure/setup/`~~ (complete)
* ~~Reorganize `src/training/` and `src/inference/` into `training/rl/`, `training/il/`, and `training/vla/`~~ (complete)
* **T0 Dev:** document the zero-cloud local loop, with optional local Kubernetes, as the sanctioned default starting path
* **T0–T2:** establish `evaluation/sil/` and `evaluation/hil/` with Isaac Sim-based evaluation pipelines
* **T0–T1:** create `data-pipeline/` with ROS 2 episodic capture (local at T0, Blob upload at T1)
* **T0–T2:** create `data-management/` with LeRobot-based episodic data viewer and curation tooling
* **T1+:** create `synthetic-data/` with NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer, Predict, and Reason integration
* **T3 Production:** create single-site `fleet-deployment/` with local k3s + FluxCD GitOps manifests and policy gating service (no Arc)
* **T4 Scale:** extend `fleet-deployment/` to multi-site fleet delivery with Azure Arc as the cross-site reachability and identity broker
* **T5 Operate (roadmap):** create `fleet-intelligence/` with Azure IoT Operations telemetry and Fabric RTI dashboards, explicitly labeled roadmap/placeholder
* Add Agent Skill specification documents (`specifications/`) in each domain directory
* Add simulation guidance documentation under `docs/simulation/`

**Won't Do:**

* Maintain a separate simulation code domain (NVIDIA provides comprehensive OSS tooling)
* Build custom robot hardware drivers or firmware
* Implement production SLA monitoring beyond reference dashboard examples
* Ship `T5` fleet intelligence as production capability in this window: it remains a roadmap direction today

## The Autonomy Ladder (T5.0–T5.3)

Fleet intelligence (`T5`) is not a single leap. It decomposes into four ordered stages of increasing decision authority, mirroring the canonical [autonomy ladder](../design/tier-model.md#the-autonomy-ladder-t50t53). Each is a legitimate stopping point; three of the four are unbuilt today (modulo an ad-hoc experiment by the team on Hex).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Autonomy (`T5.0`–`T5.3`) is a **different axis** from infrastructure reach (`T0`–`T4`). `T0`–`T4` scale on *infrastructure reach* (sites, GPU, collaboration); `T5.0`–`T5.3` scale on *decision authority / loop closure*. They are orthogonal: a single-site `T3` operator can sit at `T5.0`, and a multi-site `T4` operator can remain fully manual. The autonomy stages are how much of the retraining decision a human delegates, not more infrastructure to buy.

| Rung | Decision authority                                                                    | Human role                            | Status       |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------|
| T5.0 | Gated retraining: the system surfaces signals only; humans trigger retraining.        | Human triggers every retraining cycle | Not built    |
| T5.1 | Human-in-the-loop / active learning: the system proposes what to retrain on and when. | Human approves each cycle             | Ad-hoc (Hex) |
| T5.2 | Continual learning: the system retrains on a schedule or trigger.                     | Human reviews before deployment       | Not built    |
| T5.3 | Autonomous closed-loop: the system detects drift, retrains, gates, and deploys.       | None (fully autonomous)               | Not built    |

> [!WARNING]
> Fully autonomous retraining on production data is a foot-gun: a legitimate distribution change can cause the loop to bake current degraded behavior into the next dataset, and drift detection needs statistical power that only exists at fleet scale. `T5` should default to human-supervised (`T5.0`–`T5.1`), not closed-loop (`T5.3`). `T5.3` stays a roadmap direction, not a near-term target.

## Out of Scope

* Production SLA or uptime guarantees
* Multi-cloud support
* Custom robot hardware integration guides
* Paid support tiers or enterprise licensing
* Backward compatibility guarantees for infrastructure modules
* Automated deployment pipelines for end users

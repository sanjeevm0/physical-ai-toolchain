# Recipes

Step-by-step guides that take you from a standing start to a working result. Each recipe is self-contained with prerequisites, runnable commands, and verification steps.

Recipes are organized two ways: by **tier** (how much infrastructure you run) and by **topic** (what task you are doing). New users should start with the tier ladder below; the [default path is T0 — Dev](tier-0-dev/README.md), which runs the full training lifecycle loop on one laptop with zero cloud and no required Kubernetes.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the cloud tiers (**T2+**) and the topic recipes under [Training](#training) and [Data Collection](#data-collection) assume deployed Azure infrastructure. [T0 — Dev](tier-0-dev/README.md) and the storage-only [T1 — Lab](tier-1-lab/README.md) do not. If a recipe needs cloud resources, complete the [Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md) first. For the canonical tier definitions, see the [tier model](../design/tier-model.md).

## 🪜 Pick a Tier

Each tier states the minimum infrastructure it assumes. Start at the default (T0) and graduate only when a real constraint forces it.

| T# | Recipe                                         | Minimum infrastructure                                                       | Status          |

| T1 | [T1 — Lab](tier-1-lab/README.md)               | T0 + one Azure Blob storage account.                                         | Authored        |
| T2 | [T2 — Pilot](tier-2-pilot/README.md)           | AzureML + storage + registry + MLflow. No k8s.                               | Recommended     |
| T3 | [T3 — Production](tier-3-production/README.md) | T2 + single-site local k3s + FluxCD. No Arc.                                 | Advanced (stub) |
| T4 | [T4 — Scale](tier-4-scale/README.md)           | Multi-site Arc + AKS/Flux + gating.                                          | Advanced (stub) |
| T5 | [T5 — Operate](tier-5-operate/README.md)       | T4 + IoT Operations + Fabric RTI (roadmap).                                  | Roadmap (stub)  |

## 🗂️ Topic Recipes by Tier

The existing topic recipes assume the tier shown below. They are unchanged by the tier ladder. This table only classifies them.

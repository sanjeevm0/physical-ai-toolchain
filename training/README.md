# Training

Policy training for physical AI using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and vision-language-action approaches. Training runs in NVIDIA Isaac Lab containers on GPU nodes via AzureML or OSMO.

## 🏋️ Training Approaches

| Approach               | Directory | Framework                            | Status  |
|------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| Reinforcement Learning | `rl/`     | SKRL (primary), RSL-RL (alternative) | Active  |
| Imitation Learning     | `il/`     | LeRobot (ACT, Diffusion policies)    | Active  |
| Vision-Language-Action | `vla/`    | Multi-modal transformer policies     | Planned |

## 🚀 Submission

Training jobs submit via AzureML or OSMO. Each approach has dedicated submission scripts and workflow definitions.

| Approach | AzureML Script                                  | OSMO Script                                  |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| RL       | `rl/scripts/submit-azureml-training.sh`         | `rl/scripts/submit-osmo-training.sh`         |
| IL       | `il/scripts/submit-azureml-lerobot-training.sh` | `il/scripts/submit-osmo-lerobot-training.sh` |

> [!TIP]
> Mirror completed OSMO runs to Azure ML for model versioning. See [Azure ML Mirror](../infrastructure/setup/README.md#️-azure-ml-mirror-optional) in the cluster setup guide.

## 📦 Packaging

Trained policies export to ONNX and TensorRT formats via `packaging/scripts/export_policy.py`. See [Packaging Specification](specifications/packaging.specification.md) for details.
